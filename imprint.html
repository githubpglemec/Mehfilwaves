            <p>Dear Viewer,</p>
            
            <p>Thank you for exploring <strong>Mehfil Waves</strong>. This project began as a creative spark when I was listening to some old Bollywood music that triggered a deep sense of nostalgia and inspiration. I wanted to create a space that combines the power of sound masking with immersive visualsâ€”helping people focus amidst the noise. This is a tribute to those moments when music, much like a wave, carries us through our tasks, thoughts, and journeys.</p>
            
            <p>The video background used in this project has been sourced from <strong>Pexels</strong> (with a license that allows for free usage). I'd like to note that the video was downloaded from their platform, where it was made available for free use with no restrictions, according to their terms.</p>
            
            <h2>Design Concept & Direction:</h2>
            <p>The overall design, including the visual concept and the direction of this project, was envisioned and executed by <strong>Poozan </strong>, who is associated with <strong>Pgdesigns</strong>. I wanted to create something that felt both modern and calming, while delivering the core idea of focusing through sound in noisy environments.</p>
